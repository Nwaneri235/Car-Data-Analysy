### Project Overview

The car sales analysis provides a comprehensive examination of sales data to understand trends, patterns, and factors affecting car purchases. This analysis aims to offer insights into how different variables such as price, make, model, and geographical location influence car sales over a given period. By analyzing this data, car dealerships, manufacturers, and industry stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, pricing models, inventory management, and customer preferences. The goal of this report is to offer actionable insights for improving sales performance and enhancing customer satisfaction

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

Data cleaning and preparation is a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The raw data collected was first examined for inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Missing values were handled through imputation or exclusion depending on the nature of the variable. Duplicates were identified and removed to avoid skewed results. Data formatting was standardized, ensuring uniformity in numerical and categorical fields such as price, model names, and sale dates. Finally, data transformation techniques were applied, such as encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical values, to make the dataset ready for analysis.

### Explanatory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover underlying patterns, relationships, and trends in the car sales data. 
- What is the Visualizations, such as bar charts, pie chart were created to provide an initial understanding of the distribution of key variables like price, car brand, and sales region?
- What Correlation matrices were generated to identify potential relationships between variables, such as the effect of vehicle price on sales volume.
- Summary statistics, EDA provided valuable insights into the data, guiding subsequent modeling and analysis phases.

### Result/Findings

The analysis revealed several key findings that provide insights into car sales trends. For example, 
1. Higher-priced cars tended to have lower sales volume, while mid-range vehicles saw the highest demand.
2. Geographically, urban areas showed a higher concentration of sales compared to rural regions, likely due to differences in income levels and accessibility.
3. Additionally, certain car brands and models emerged as clear leaders in sales, with customer preferences aligning with factors such as reliability and fuel efficiency.
4. Promotional events and seasonal trends also significantly impacted sales, with certain months showing higher sales spikes.
These findings offer valuable guidance for market segmentation and targeted sales strategies.

### Recommedations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize sales.
- Encourage people in urban areas by given car loans or discounts on purchases.
- Implement a customer segmentation to target high Network customers effectively.

### Limitations 

While the analysis provided valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged. 
First, the data available was limited in terms of completeness for some locations and car models. Missing data or inconsistent reporting from certain sources may have led to potential biases in the analysis. 
Second, external factors such as economic shifts, global events, and supply chain disruptions were not incorporated into the model, which could have impacted sales trends. 
Lastly, the analysis focused primarily on historical data, which may not fully account for rapid market changes or future trends, limiting the predictive power of the insights generated.
